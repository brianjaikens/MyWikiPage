## How to Navigate

Click on any link above to navigate to that page. All internal links between markdown files are automatically converted to work with the generated HTML pages.

## Editing Content

To add or modify content:

1. Edit the markdown files in the markdown folder
2. Use the "Refresh Wiki" button on the wiki management page
3. View your updated content

The system automatically processes internal links, so you can reference other markdown files using their `.md` extension and they'll work correctly in the generated HTML.
